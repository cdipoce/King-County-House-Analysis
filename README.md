This project was done for the Waterloo Data Science 1: Foundations of Data Science course.
Co-authored by: qhamzah97 and pygmie73
  
In the project, we analyzed residential property sales data in the King County, USA over the timeframe 2014-2015.
The public dataset for was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

Our aim was to create a grading system that would correlate with the sales prices better than the county's official property grades. 
Three different Machine Learning Models (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network) were considered.
  
We successfully developed a (Random Forest) model that uses far less parameters but yet correlates with sales price significantly higher than does the King County's grade.
